# About me


<img align="right" style="width: 250px; margin-left: 30px;" src="/assets/img/familjen.jpg">
My name is Mikael Asp Somkane and I'm a dad, husband and programmer. I program
for a living, but I've been home for almost 1.5 years due to sickness. I have
terminal cancer, but so far my medicine is keeping the tumours quite. They
neither shrink nor grow, but they will never go away. 

This blog is a way for me to keep the thoughts away and do something fun and
hopefully useful for someone else.

## Music

I listen a lot to music and I listen to everything from Techno to Heavy Metal
with some progressive rock, hip-hop and jazz in between.

I especially love these artists:

* Pink Floyd
* Adam Beyer
* Extreme
* Frank Zappa
* Front 242
* King Diamond
* Larry Carlton
* Nas

## Litterature

I try to read now and then. I read mostly facts and occasionally science fiction
or fantasy. In science fiction I really like Arthur C. Clark, Isaac Asimov and
Douglas Adams. In science it's Richard Dawkins. I read too little fantasy to
have a favourite, but I do like JRR Tolkien a lot.



Feel free to contact me on Twitter, where I am several times per day.
