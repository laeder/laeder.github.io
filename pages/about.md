# About me

My name is Mikael Asp Somkane and I'm a dad, husband and programmer. I program
for a living, but I've been home for almost 1.5 years due to sickness. I have
terminal cancer, but so far my medicine is keeping the tumours quite. They
neither shrink nor grow, but they will never go away. 

This blog is a way for me to keep the thoughts away and do something fun and
hopefully useful for someone else.

Feel free to contact me on Twitter, where I am several times per day.
