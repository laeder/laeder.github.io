Nuno is probably the biggest influence on my own playing. I love his playing
style. There's a lot of funk, rock and even shred to it. He's just incredible. 

I discovered Extreme when I was about 21 and I was thrilled. It was the album
Pornograffitti and I loved every song on that album and especially Nuno's guitar
playing. He can really keep the rythm with good riffs as well as exploding in
lightning fast solos and he's a good singer as well.

My favourite album is III sides to every story. It's a concept album divided
into three sides; Yours, Mine and The Truth. Yours sounds like the Extreme we're
used to with funky metal and rock songs. Mine is rather the opposite with soft
songs with piano and some even without guitars. The truth sounds more like
progressive rock with an orchestra and this is my favourite "side". The second
song "Am I ever gonna change" in The truth side is possibly my favourite Extreme
song.
