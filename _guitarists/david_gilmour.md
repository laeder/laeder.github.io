David Gilmour is my absolute favourite guitarist. I started listening to Pink
Floyd for real when I was about 18 and he just blew me away. The wall is my top
album and there are so many songs on that album with fantastic guitars.

His style is grounded in blues, long bended notes and with a touch that is
unmistakingly his. I've seen a lot of videos with players getting pretty much
the same gear, but they still don't sound like Gilmour because you can't copy
his fingers or his personality.
