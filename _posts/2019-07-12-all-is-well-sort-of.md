I went to the doctor yesterday to get my results from my lastest x-ray. My brain
tumours are the same size as before, the thing that was growing on my left
kidney is actually shrinking, but one lymph node in my chest is slowly growing
and something they will keep an I on.

I feels great to be able to relax another 3-4 months until next x-ray. Not
knowing what the doctor will say is scary. But this little blog is something I
cherish and it makes me happy to think about different subjects to write about
and to actually write them.

By the way, today a friend married his sweet girlfriend. We were there and also
met his parents. Really nice day with friends and good food. That's also
something to be happy about.

I wish you all a nice weekend and take care of each other.
