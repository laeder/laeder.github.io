Today I added a book collection. You can find it at the top together with the
categories. Collections are great if you want to add something where every
document will be similar such as book reviews, blog authors, staff or recepies.

I read a lot of books when I was younger and somehow I hope that this will make
me read more. I have a Kobo for reading e-books and I also enjoy reading physical
books.

I started by adding a book I read a long time ago, but it's a book that means a
lot to me. It was the first book I read in English from cover to cover and it
introduced me to Douglas Coupland which became one of my favorite authors. I
like to talk about the Douglases, Adams and Coupland. I love them both.
