This was not an easy book to read. I've read som astrophysics before, but this
was on a complete other level. It's interesting and sometimes captivating, but
Krauss lacks some of Dawkins ability to explain so that everyone will
understand. And it's understandable, Dawkins has been writing books and teaching
evolution for decades. Krauss clearly knows what he talks about and wants us to
understand and does a decent job doing that. 

I probably have to read this book again since there was so much to take in and
rather complex too. And it's a book that should be read slowly while trying to
absorb the mass of information. The reason I mentioned Dawkins is that Dawkins
wrote the afterword.
