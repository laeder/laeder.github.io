This was the first book that I read from cover to cover in English. And thanks
to this book I now know the meaning of the word dandruff ;)

I really liked this book. It's funny, romantic, geeky and heart warming. As a
programmer I feel at home in this company. I also feel with the father that lost
his job and his feeling of losing his purpose.
